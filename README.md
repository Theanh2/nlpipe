PROGRAMMING A PIPELINE FOR NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING
> As part of my bachelor thesis, I program multiple Pipelines for the use in natural language processing.
> The main focus is user friendly code that can be run with even without deep knowledge about language processing, while maintaining the modularity to change hyper/parameter and techniques as you like.
